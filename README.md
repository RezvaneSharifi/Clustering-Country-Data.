# Clustering-Country-Data.
**Overview:**  
HELP International is a humanitarian organization that works towards fighting poverty and providing basic necessities to people in underdeveloped countries. The organization has recently raised approximately $10 million, and the CEO is now faced with the task of deciding how to allocate these funds effectively. The main challenge is to determine which countries are in dire need of aid.

**Data:**  
We have used the HELP International Dataset for this project, which can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/code/amritachatterjee09/clustering-help-international-ngo-aid. This dataset contains information for 167 countries on various development indicators such as health, child morth, income, etc.

**Methodology:**  
We have used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimension reduction and K-means clustering to group similar countries together. We continued the clustering process until we achieved a cluster containing 20 countries in dire need of financial assistance. This approach helped us efficiently identify those in the most need of aid

**Results:**  
Most of the countries identified as requiring aid are located in Africa. The list of these countries, along with their respective cluster numbers, is available in the project report.

**Conclusion:**  
Our analysis has helped identify the most vulnerable countries and regions that require urgent aid. We hope that our findings will assist HELP International in making informed decisions about allocating their funds to where it is needed the most.
